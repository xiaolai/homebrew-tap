  # Homebrew can only express a MAJOR macOS version here, so this is
  # :ventura (13.0) while the real floor is 13.4 — see
  # scripts/check-webview-floor.mjs. The precise gate stays
  # LSMinimumSystemVersion from tauri.conf.json, which refuses to
  # open with a readable message; this line keeps  from
  # cheerfully installing onto Catalina, which it did until #1278.
