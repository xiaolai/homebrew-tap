  # url/sha256 MUST be set at the top level, not inside an
  # `on_linux do` block. Homebrew evaluates the formula DSL at
  # LOAD time on every platform and requires a url
  # unconditionally — with the stanzas nested in `on_linux`,
  # loading on macOS raised
  #   "claudepot: formula requires at least a URL"
  # and every `brew` command touching the bare name
  # `claudepot` printed that error before falling through to
  # the cask. `Hardware::CPU.arm?` evaluates fine on macOS, so
  # the conditional is safe here; `depends_on :linux` is what
  # actually prevents installing it on a Mac.
